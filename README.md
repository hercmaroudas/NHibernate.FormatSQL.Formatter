# NHibernate.FormatSQL.Formatter
Obtains NHibernate Sql from Viaual Studio output window and creates NHibernate.FormatSQL.Formatter.ISqlStatement objects that can be used to format obscured table and column names.

Unfortunately because of privacy agreement at work place I was unable to add resource file containing SQL used in most of my UnitTests. 

If the NHibernate.FormatSQL.Formatter.Tests project gives you any problems either add a default Properties.Resources.resx file to the project or just make the project unavaailable in 
the visual studio environment.
